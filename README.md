# TelegramWordsBot
Simple hobby project to try chatbot development.

The Idea of a bot is to provide foreign words learning functionality.
Target language will be Estonian in my case.

Ideas:
-in Kotlin (Try out kotlin in practice as well)
-Train known words (all forms, some forms)
-Ask bot for word you not sure about (lookup some dictionary?)
-Reminder to train, postpone


Next steps (leave it here for now):
